I released a graphic application in Java which involves working with relational databases using JDBC, providing functionalities such as adding, modifying, deleting, searching, filtering, and sorting data. Additionally, it allows for generating reports and diagrams/graphs based on the database data. Exporting to PDF and XLS formats, importing from XLS, and maintaining a usage history of the application are also implemented features.
